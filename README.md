# rscheme
This is a bare-bone scheme REPL written in Rust. It supports basic operations, custom function definition (does not support defining functions inside other functions), recursion, variables and higher-order functions.
It is not meant to be used in a production environment, it is merely an exercise to learn Rust and improve my skills.
